## The problem

Sometimes it is needed to include a wide/tall content on the page which may break the design. For example,
a big table. Of course it is possible to put it into the scrollable box, but it will not look good for 
mobile devices - iPad, for example. 

## The solution

Add a button which expands the page's part to the whole screen

Note that plugin does not switch browser into full screen mode for now. It was created for expanding pages on iPad which Safari browser does not support full screen mode.
